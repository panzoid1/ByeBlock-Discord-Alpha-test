# ByeBlock-Discord
Say Bye Block - Discord

💬Hello everybody thank you for testing my app, this is my first project
For the start i wanna say, this isn't ready version more function isn't available,
I will be updating project and once this will full project for use I let you know

📌So, let's get to the point,
1 just open it ByeBlock-Discord-0.0.0.1.exe
2 Settings-Add Proxy and add proxy
3 Main-Reload
4 Log in to your account

That's All.

# Why is it better than a regular discord ❓
1. You don't need to update the app every time, as it always updates itself ✔️
2. The application weighs very little ✔️
3. This is official and we do not collect any data about you, and therefore the code is open ✔️
4. Your opinion is important to us ✔️


# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ERRORS THAT WE KNOW ⚠️⚠️⚠️
